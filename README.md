# ChatApp
This is a Post-Bootcamp personal project that I am making so I can a handle on how to use Sockets.io with React.js. The inspiration of this project came from not knowing how to use both of these technologies simultaneously on my last project for the bootcamp. This is purely a demonstration and for educational purposes.
